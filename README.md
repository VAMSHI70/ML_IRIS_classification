# ML_IRIS_classification
Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification repository, where we demonstrate the implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for accurately classifying iris flowers. This project focuses specifically on utilizing the k-NN algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on their petal and sepal characteristics.
To run this program we need to install python and  numpy 
pandas 
seaborn 
matplotlib
 sklearn
 for this we need to install by using the commands in command prompt 
 pip install numpy
  pip install pandas 
   pip install seaborn 
   pip install matplotlib
    pip install sklearn
and use the iris.csv in the same folder.
